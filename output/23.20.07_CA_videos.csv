Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought… how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about “Watchbait” the movie version of “Clickbait”. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn’t compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn’t a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a “Talks About” video, but nah. We made a new show called “Beyond the Black Void” and if you ever see one of these again, it’s just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I’d be shocked if one of these pictures weren’t some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that’s why Jay “downloaded all of them on his dark web server” whatever that means. And yes, it’s 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where’s he’s done many power squats and asked me “What we shootin’ Mike?” and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn’t know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for… you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy."

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? Video producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. Along the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US — starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government’s takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever? Join Dean on his journey as he sets out to find out the answer to these questions and more.Sources:The Great Railroad Revolution by Christian Wolmarhttps://www.amazon.com/Great-Railroad-Revolution-History-America/dp/1610393473Amtrak, America's Railroad: Transportation's Orphan and Its Struggle for Survival (Railroads Past and Present) by  Geoffrey H.

Often described as a show about nothing, Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #TheBeardGeorge's Toupée Turns Him Into A Jerk | The Beard | Seinfeldhttps://bit.ly/OfficialSeinfeld"

High school went by so fast, and although I didn't really enjoy calculating velocity vectors or writing 5 paragraph essays with a works cited, I would never take back a single moment that I had with you all. I've come to realize that friendship is one of the most valuable things in the world, and I can't thank you enough. You all supported me when YouTube was just a dream, and you never changed when that dream became a reality. But, you did so much more. You made me crack up when I was at my lowest points. You pushed me when I didn't feel like moving forward. You were all so true to yourself, and I appreciate you all so much for that. 7 years zipped by, but the memories we made together will stick with me forever. I was gonna submit a speech for graduation, but I'd much rather make a YouTube video XD. I'm gonna miss you guys, but I'll always have your back no matter what. Love ya!"

The arcades include highly detailed machines with realistic physics that are inspired by modern arcade machines. There are ticket redemption areas to exchange your counted tickets for all kinds of fun prizes. Larry's Arcade has an in-house animatronic band called Teddy and the Ticket Eaters that would love to play you some tunes while you enjoy the arcade. The most recent addition to Islandville island, UFO Arcade features modern space inspired arcade machines, Lazer Tag and an Indoor Go Kart Race Track. Make sure to watch out for the minions, they really love Teddy and his band and they also are pretty good at Lazer Tag. Run out of money? That's ok. You can work odd jobs around the island to get back on your feet. Got extra prizes? The island has a Pawn Shop that will buy your used prizes for cash so you can go blow it back at the arcade.The Coin Game also features a full fledged Traveling Carnival with over 20 classic games, rides and machines to choose from. The carnival also brings new prizes to win, hoard or sell for cash at Barrys pawn shop. The rides are all interactive and are overpriced just like in real life... so you better be winning, working or begging Uncle Phil for more spending cash if you want to enjoy them. (Birthday mode is unlimited money for all you lazies out there that just want to live off of Uncle Phils wallet and have a good time. So dont worry he has you covered). But dont get comfy as Survivor Mode is still being developed. ;)You can play The Coin Game anyway that you like. For the laid back players, you can just play the fun games and win tickets to exchange for silly prizes. You don't have to worry about anything but winning tickets. Unlimited money. No curfews. No rules.... just arcade freedom brought to you by your rich Uncle Phil.The Coin Game includes all the fun activities of a real trip to the arcade. Including drinking soda all day, dodging sugar filled minions and living off of vending machine cheesy poofs. To earn a little extra money you can scavenge the dumpsters and trash cans or even deliver newspapers around the island for extra spending loot. Explore the island on the Islandville bus system or even your very own golf cart.There is lots of highway traffic and tourist activity on the island all year round, so make sure to keep off the roads or you may get a little surprise. There is even a few areas planned for the future that are off limits for now and surrounded by construction fencing to keep you safe. The Islandville Transit bus is always running if you need to get around the island doing chores. To hail the bus, simply click the button in any bus stop and buy a bus pass. Each bus ride costs one pass ($1.50).With over 40 different games and machines there is already plenty to do on the island. You can play The Coin Game with any mouse, keyboard or any Dual stick/pad controller. The game includes a easy to use key mapping system to support virtually any controller or peripheral. So you can play The Coin Game any way that you like.The Coin Game is developed by a one man indie developer over the last 3 years with the wonderful support of his wife, family and 2 weiner dogs."

The translation from fresh to shelf stable, was unsuccessful in this curry dish from the Indian Subcontinent, making it's way to American trays through Savannah Georgia, Charleston South Carolina, and New York. It was also General George S. Patton's favorite dinner. A hopeful and patriotic approach to what could have been a terrific and well received menu, it didn't work out with the troops and was phased out after a 4 year service time, ranging from the year 2000 to 2004. Personally, I have a strange affinity for this menu, but many others didn't during it's prime time of usage 20 years ago.This is a fun one.For correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my exact mailing information is: Steve19893616 Harden Blvd360Lakeland, FL 33803 https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=hhttps://teespring.com/stores/steve1989"

I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can be…to say the least!I personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.On YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I don’t know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isn’t as flexible as it once was or you’ve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are I’ve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.Be prepared though. If its a quick fix you are after Im not your man. Here I will give you step-by-step advice that you can take straight to the practice ground and apply to the course but it will require you to get stuck in, screw up…a lot, practice some more and then watch those scores tumbleI’ve had the pleasure of coaching thousands of students all around the world and if you are up for the challenge and are ready to get in the game…LETS GO TO WORK!-----------------------SUBSCRIBE!!-----------------------https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1This golf lesson provides a couple of wonderful drills to help you hit your driver straight.If you are a beginner golfer and are looking for some golf driver tips that are simple and easy to do then you are going to love this.I will show you the golf swing slow motion so that you can see what you need to do to improve.We look at 3 things:1.

His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast – and it’s always been that way. Listen to “White Iverson” again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‘beerbongs & bentleys’ and ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ and you’ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we’re waiting for ‘Austin,’ Posty’s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it’s “some of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least – trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.” To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he’s leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of “Overdrive,” one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.Watch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmaloneFollow Post Malone:https://www.postmalone.comhttps://instagram.com/postmalonehttps://twitter.com/postmalonehttps://facebook.com/postmalonehttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalonehttps://tiktok.com/@postmalonehttps://discord.gg/post-maloneFollow VevoFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevoTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevoInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevoTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevoExecutive Producer: JP EvangelistaExecutive Producer: Chris PereiraExecutive Producer: Jordy WaxDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth HalterCreative Director, Production: Liz HartLine Producer: Haley SligerLine Producer: Stacey BransonProduction Manager: Cole EmeryDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-YiProduction Designer: Tyler JensenMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam MackoffPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler ArnoldEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny ReyesVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan StevensAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie BaumsteinSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim HrycyshynSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin1st AD: Derek Jaeschke2nd AD: Delaney Forrey1st AC: Pancho Ortiz2nd AC: Kate RuthenbeckDIT: Shawn AguilarSteadicam Operator: Jose EspinozaCrane Camera Operator: Chris HerrCrane Operator: Garrett DorinCrane Tech: Nazariy HatakRemote Head Tech: Alexandre NunezGaffer: Nick DurrBB Electric: Jasper KhadjenouriElectric / Driver: Victor Noel ArenalElectric: Justin RoxbroughElectric: Rodolfo MartinezElectric: Isaac HanElectric: Charlie HayesBoard Operator: Patrick MattesKey Grip: Luke PooleBB Grip: Justen HernandezGrip: Steven AlboviasGrip: Nick HermanGrip: Grayson VentersGrip: Ryan ElviraArt Director: Danny ErbSet Decorator: Michael CourseyLeadman: Montana BertolettiSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina SkilbredSet Dresser: Eric MooreSet Dresser: Kris IngramScenic Painter: Jesse HotchkissSet Dresser: Abe TurnerArtist Management: Dre LondonArtist Management: Bobby GreenleafArtist Management: Austin RosenProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.
