It gives MPs the chance to put questions to the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak MP, or a nominated minister.In most cases, the session starts with a routine 'open question' from an MP about the Prime Minister's engagements. MPs can then ask supplementary questions on any subject, often one of current political significance.The Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer MP, asks six questions and the leader of the second largest opposition party asks two. If another minister takes the place of the Prime Minister, opposition parties will usually nominate a shadow minister to ask the questions.Want to find out more about what's happening in the House of Commons this week?

Matt Damon (Leslie Groves) discusses why he thinks of Nolan as an engineer of a film set, relating the auteur's scientific ingenuity to a behind-the-scenes moment from 'Inception' (2010). Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) discusses the whirlwind production, and how the film's pace may seem dizzying, but the experience on set was one of creative freedom and artistic support. And #RobertDowneyJr. (Lewis Strauss) reveals his own misconceptions of what it'd be like to work with Nolan before heaping praise on Murphy for not only his performance, but also his leadership that made the whole cast want to elevate their own performances.

Their reason today? To talk about a new huge summer blockbuster movie? No. Quite the opposite. They was gonna talk about Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 2: Dead Reckoning 1, BUT they thought‚Ä¶ how many times can one see Tom Cruise do stints? No, this day Mike, Jay, and Rich have returned to the black void to talk about ‚ÄúWatchbait‚Äù the movie version of ‚ÄúClickbait‚Äù. Trash that has overrun a once great institution like Tubi. And before you ask, no we wasn‚Äôt compensated by Tubi to promote these films. We were just browsing about and saw a trend. A trend of using certain words or phrases in a title to get one to click on their junk film to watch it, only to realize after a few minutes they made the worst mistake of their lives. This particular video wasn‚Äôt a Half in the Bag. Nor was it a re:View. Nor was it a Best of the Worst. I guess it could have been a ‚ÄúTalks About‚Äù video, but nah. We made a new show called ‚ÄúBeyond the Black Void‚Äù and if you ever see one of these again, it‚Äôs just Mike, Jay and Rich Evens talking about something of interest. In solidarity with the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strike we decided to talk about movies that in no way whatsoever could have possibly been made under any conceivable union agreement. In fact, I‚Äôd be shocked if one of these pictures weren‚Äôt some kind of nudie snuff film. Maybe that‚Äôs why Jay ‚Äúdownloaded all of them on his dark web server‚Äù whatever that means. And yes, it‚Äôs 100% true, we did just spring this whole thing on Rich Evans. I rang him up on my landline to tell him to come to the studio. Well, actually I left a message on his answering machine. He showed up coming from the gym where‚Äôs he‚Äôs done many power squats and asked me ‚ÄúWhat we shootin‚Äô Mike?‚Äù and I tell him to sit down and shut up you shit-for-brains. He sits down, but there is an immediate squish sound. It would appear that Rich had soiled his large diaper. He claimed he didn‚Äôt know. He insisted he ONLY wears a diaper when he does power squats at the gym. 1. it helps stifle the sound of any accidental fart release, but also for‚Ä¶ you know what. An accidental Hershey squirt. This is apparently what happened. Luckily a very large toddler had died outside our building and I was able to provide Rich Evans with replacement clothing. A lot went into this video. So please, enjoy."

How did the US go from having luxurious, widely used passenger trains to the Amtrak system we have today? Video producer Dean Peterson makes a 72-hour journey on Amtrak from LA to NYC to show its current state of operation. From getting kicked in the head by his sleeping seat mate to taking in sweeping views of the desert at sunset, Dean shows the highs and lows of being stuck on Amtrak for days on end. Along the way, he explains the history of passenger rail in the US ‚Äî starting in the problematic robber baron era to the US government‚Äôs takeover of passenger rail. Will the United States ever catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to train travel, or are Americans stuck with an underfunded, inefficient rail network forever?

Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. A Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy! Thanks to Slatcho for the help editing: https://linktr.ee/slatcho?utm_source=linktree_admin_shareIf anyone on School SMP is reading this: We did it! High school went by so fast, and although I didn't really enjoy calculating velocity vectors or writing 5 paragraph essays with a works cited, I would never take back a single moment that I had with you all. I've come to realize that friendship is one of the most valuable things in the world, and I can't thank you enough. You all supported me when YouTube was just a dream, and you never changed when that dream became a reality. But, you did so much more. You made me crack up when I was at my lowest points. You pushed me when I didn't feel like moving forward. You were all so true to yourself, and I appreciate you all so much for that. 7 years zipped by, but the memories we made together will stick with me forever. I was gonna submit a speech for graduation, but I'd much rather make a YouTube video XD. I'm gonna miss you guys, but I'll always have your back no matter what. Love ya!"
